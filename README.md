Data Structures and Algorithms
The following have been implemented so far:

##Data Structures
1. Arrays

2. Lists

3. Linked Lists

4. Stacks

5. Queues

6. Linked Lists

7. Simple Trees

8. Binary Search Trees

9. Graphs and Graphs Algorithms

10. Heaps

##Algorithms
11. Bubble Sort Algorithm
		The elements during the bubble sorting is like bubbles in the water floating up to the surface.

		When sorting a set of numbers into ascending order, larger values float to the right of the array and lower values float to the left.

		The algorithm moves through the array many times, compares adjacent values, and swaps them if the value to the left is greater than the value to the right.

12. Selection Sort Algorithm

13. Insertion Sort Algorithm

14. Shell Sort Algorithm

15. Merge Sort Algorithm

16. Quick Sort Algorithm
