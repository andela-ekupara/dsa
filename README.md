Data Structures and Algorithms
The following have been implemented so far:

##Data Structures
1. Arrays
		An array is a linear collection of elements.
		Array elements can be accessed via indices.
		Array index is usually integer value used to compute offsets.
		The first element in an array has the index of 0.

2. Lists
		A list is an ordered sequence of data. 
		Each data item stored in a list is called an element. 
		A list with no elements is an empty list. 
		The number of elements stored in a list is called the length of the list. 
		We can append an element to the end of a list, or we can insert an element into a list after an existing element or at the beginning of a list. 
		Elements are deleted from a list using a remove operation. 		We can also clear a list so that all of its current elements are removed.
		The elements of a list are displayed using either a toString() operation.
		getElement() operation displays the value of the current element.
		We can move from one element of a list to the next element using the next() operation, and we can move backward through a list using the prev() operation.
		We can also move to a numbered position in a list using the moveTo(n) operation, where n specifies the position to move to.
		The currentPosition property indicates the current position in a list.

##Algorithms
11. Bubble Sort Algorithm
		The elements during the bubble sorting is like bubbles in the water floating up to the surface.

		When sorting a set of numbers into ascending order, larger values float to the right of the array and lower values float to the left.

		The algorithm moves through the array many times, compares adjacent values, and swaps them if the value to the left is greater than the value to the right.

12. Selection Sort Algorithm
		The sorting algorithm works by starting at the beginning of the array and comparing the first element with the remaining elements.

		After examining all the elements, the smallest element is placed in the first position, and the algorithm moves to the second position.

		This process continues until the algorithm arrives at the next to last position in the array.

		Nested loops are used in the selection sort algorithm.

The outer loop moves from the first element in the array to the next to last element; the inner loop moves from the second array element to the last element.
